# Q: If we eat Fish on St David's Day, Crab on US Independence Day and Goat
#    on Christmas Day, what do we eat on Halloween?

# Observations
#
# 1. All foods have four letters
# 2. All days are holidays
#   - St David's Day        1 March     (1-3, 3/1)
#   - US Independence Day   4 July      (4-7, 7/4)
#   - Christmas Day         25 December (25-12, 12/25)
#   - Halloween             31 October  (31-10, 10/31)
# 3. Halloween is the third of the four holidays, which may put it logically
#    between US Independence Day and Christmas Day in terms of food as well
