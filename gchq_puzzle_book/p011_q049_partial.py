# 49. Game scores
# Q: If Monopoly scores 15 and Cluedo scores 9, which board game scores 14?

# Observations:
#
# 1. Game scores... scrabble gives scores to words.
# 
# Monopoly scores 3+1+1+1+3+1+1+4 = 15 in scrabble
# Cluedo scores 3+1+1+1+2+1 = 9 in scrabble

# A: 
#    TODO: Make a Python script to calculate the monopoly scores of each word (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_letter_distributions#English), then find a list of board games and find the game with 14 points.
