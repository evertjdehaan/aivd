# 13. A round of drinks
# Q: What could follow Mojito, Eggnog, Riesling, Lemonade, Ouzo, ?

# Observations
#
# 1. All words are drinks (as the title suggests).
# 2. There is not a single correct answer ("could follow").
# 3. The words start with M-E-R-L-O-?, almost spelling "Merlot", being a drink itself.

# A: Tea (all double consonants/vowels behind one another).
# A: Tahn (if you believe that the word length (6-6-8-8-4-?) suggests that the last word should be 4 letters in length)
